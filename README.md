Script that won't let the computer sleep

It happens that in corporations there are screensavers set up, which for example cannot be turned off due to internal regulations. However, this can be a problem.
This can be solved, for example, by running this script, which will not let the computer sleep.

Also the status in Teams will still be available.

Condition: Do not have battery saving mode turned on
